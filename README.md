## Brief Description
I designed custom UI in figma for this app. It was amazing, it took me 1 day to finilize UI,
after I created UI first of all that won't took to much, now the main journey started, now I have started implementing functionality and api stuff, then installed zustand built the state hooks it was working great, then I faced one issue, my parent component was not re-rending after update state in child component, I tried hard, but it was taking time, I almost wasted more than 8hrs behind Zustand then finillaly decided to shift on redux, it was boring to write redux boiler plate, but it did not disappointed me. It was nice experience building this app.
